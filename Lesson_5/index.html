        <p class="para-one">While metal music got some negative coverage in its early days, there’s absolutely no doubt
            that it made a
            huge mark on modern music in general. And as it evolved, it began impacting other genres as well, even
            taking an important place in mainstream waters.</p>
        <img src="img/James-Hetfield-Playing-the-Guitar.jpg" alt="James-Hetfield-Playing-the-Guitar">
        <p class="para-two">But although it’s widely accepted that the Metal genre started in the late 1960s and the
            early 1970s with
            bands like Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Deep Purple, the 1980s bands innovated the genre in a way that
            made it their own, and that’s especially the case with Metallica.</p>
        <h2>What Guitar Does James Hetfield Play?</h2>
        <p class="para-three">James Hetfield primarily plays Explorer-style guitars made by Ken Lawrence, Gibson, as
            well as ESP. James is
            also known to own and play several V-style guitars as well as Les Pauls. He’s played many others throughout
            his career.</p>
        <p class="para-four"><span>See the full list of most notable James Hetfield guitars below.</span></p>

    <main>
        <div class="carl" id="carl">
            <h2>Ken Lawrence Explorer, aka “Carl”</h2>
            <img src="img/Ken-Lawrence-Explorer-Carl.jpg" alt="Ken-Lawrence-Explorer-Carl">
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Finish - Natural with Custom Details</li>
                <li>Years Used - 2012 to Present</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para-one">And we’ll start things off with one rather sentimental instrument built for James by Ken
                Lawrence. Back
                in
                the late 1990s and the early 2010s, Metallica considered actually buying an old garage where they used
                to
                rehearse in the early 1980s. <span>Although they found out that the garage was demolished</span>, they
                got ahold of
                some
                old wood that was, for some reason, kept by one of their friends.</p>
            <p class="para-two">Being a very thorough guitar builder, Ken took his time to finish it up. Some pretty
                nice aesthetic
                touches
                on this Explorer were done by Serbian artist Petar Milivojević and they actually tell some stories about
                Metallica history. The body is accompanied by a mahogany neck and an African Blackwood fretboard. The
                nickname “Carl” is a reference to Carlson Blvd in El Cerrito, California where their old rehearsal place
                was
                located. This is also known as the James Hetfield garage guitar.</p>

            <h2>1996 Custom Ken Lawrence Explorer</h2>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Finish - Natural</li>
                <li>Years Used - 1996 to Present</li>
            </ul>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZTJBViOoik&feature=emb_logo">Metallica: Enter Sandman (Trondheim,
                Norway - July 13, 2019)</a>
            <p class="para-one">But Hetfield’s cooperation with Ken goes way back to the mid-1990s. The first instrument
                he built for him
                was a pretty-looking explorer with a mahogany body, mahogany neck, and a unique-looking headstock. It
                was initially fitted with EMG 81 and 60 active humbucker pickups, although he later swapped them with
                his signature EMG-JH humbuckers.</p>
            <p class="para-two"><mark>However, James has at least two of these Explorers. He got the second one in the
                    early
                    2000s</mark>, and this
                instrument features a Bubinga top, as well as some rather stylish fretboard inlays. You can see him
                using this second one on a lot of Metallica’s live shows, so it has seen a lot of action over the years.
                This was during the band’s “Load” and “Reload” era, which was met with somewhat mixed reactions from the
                fans but saw James utilize different sounds and techniques compared to the group’s full-on thrash metal
                period of the 1980s. When most people ask what guitar does James Hetfield plays one of his explorer
                styles guitars, such as this Ken Lawrence model, comes to mind.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="flying-ken" id="flying">
            <h2>Ken Lawrence Custom Flying V</h2>
            <img src="img/James-Hetfield-Ken-Lawrence-Custom-Flying-V.jpg" alt="Ken Lawrence Custom Flying V">
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Finish - Natural</li>
                <li>Years Used - 2011 to Present</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para-one">Another great example of Ken’s impeccable craftsmanship is James’ custom Flying V model.
                This one
                bears a pretty much identical headstock design to those on his custom Explorers, while the body
                is shaped exactly like Gibson’s classic Flying V guitars. We also have a special kind of inlay
                design, resembling a dragon or a serpent engraving and wrapped around most of the neck’s length.
                On the other hand, not much is known about this instrument, and Hetfield is not often seen
                holding it. This fella proves that James still likes to spice things up in terms of gear even
                this late into his musical career.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="gibson-custom" id="gibson">
            <h2>1973 Gibson Les Paul Custom</h2>
            <img src="img/1973-Gibson-Les-Paul-Custom.jpg" alt="1973 Gibson Les Paul Custom">
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Finish - Black Worn with Custom Details</li>
                <li>Years Used - 2002 to Present</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para-one">Being a metal musician, it’s only expected of James to have some Gibsons in his
                collection. One of the
                most interesting guitars, though, is the 1973 Les Paul Custom. It’s not sure when and where he got it,
                but the instrument came with Sperzel locking tuners, EMG 81 and 60 pickups, and golden covers. It’s
                easily recognizable with its Maltese cross behind the bridge and golden stripes on the bass side of the
                body. This one has been used heavily during the “St. Anger” era. Gibson Les Pauls are generally
                associated with later Metallica stages as far as Mr. Hetfield is considered.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="iron-cross" id="cross">
            <h2>ESP James Hetfield Iron Cross</h2>
            <img src="img/ESP-James-Hetfield-Iron-Cross.jpg" alt="ESP James Hetfield Iron Cross">
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Finish - White</li>
                <li>Years Used - 2017 to Present</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para-one">Over the years, James became quite fond of ESP guitars. So he got his own special
                custom-made guitar with
                them. This ESP model in particular is a James Hetfield signature guitar. The Iron Cross model was
                inspired by the aforementioned Gibson Les Paul Custom from 1973. Taking a look at the body, it looks
                pretty similar, though the “Iron Cross” visual is a bit different. Then we have an obviously different
                fretboard design with ESP’s famous “flag” inlays, as well as a Maltese cross inlay on the 12th fret. The
                guitar is also loaded with active pickups. ESP and ESP LTD both produce James Hetfield signature models
                that are made after this instrument. This is one of the more well-known guitars of James’ modern
                Metallica arsenal.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="snakebyte" id="snakebyte">
            <h2>ESP James Hetfield Snakebyte</h2>
            <img src="img/ESP-James-Hetfield-Snakebyte.jpg" alt="ESP James Hetfield Snakebyte">
            <ul>
                <li>Finish - White</li>
                <li>Years Used - 2015 to Present</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Snakebyte is another James Hetfield signature guitar. Knowing how fond James is of Explorer guitars,
                it’s not a surprise to see him using a bunch of different variations to this classic body shape.
                However, he has a few very interesting ESP Snakebyte guitars that were made especially for him. One of
                them is a plain white model with no special insignia on it. It’s not certain when he began using this
                particular one, but it’s most likely during the mid-2010s. This is a classic heavy metal-oriented
                instrument, bearing a mahogany body, mahogany neck, ebony fretboard, and a pair of EMG James Hetfield
                signature humbuckers. Along with the Ken Lawrence models, this is another explorer style guitar that
                comes to mind when the question is asked, what guitar does James Hetfield use?</p>

        <div class="snakebyte__baritone test" id="baritone">
            <h2>ESP James Hetfield Snakebyte Custom Baritone</h2>

                <li>Years Used - 2015 to Present</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Another of these great James Hetfield ESP Snakebyte guitars. James has two of these baritone models. The
                first featuring a unique-looking gray camo finish and the second a purple sunburst. Not many details are
                known about this instrument which he began using for the WorldWired Tour, most notably for “Sad But
                True.” This one comes with a longer baritone-style scale length, allowing for more stability when using
                those lower tunings, so you can see James using it for other down-tuned songs as well.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="eetfuk" id="eetfuk">
            <h2>ESP MX220, aka “Eet Fuk”</h2>
            <img src="img/ESP-MX220-aka-Eet-Fuk.jpg" alt="ESP MX220, aka “Eet Fuk”">
            <ul>
                <li>Finish - White</li>
                <li>Years Used - 1987 to Present</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para-one">One of the most famous instruments in James Hetfield’s collection is the ESP MX220 with
                a white finish
                and a rather unusual “EET FUK” caption on it. Getting this white Explorer-shape ESP guitar back in 1987,
                right before the recording of “…And Justice for All,” the caption was added sometimes in 1988.</p>
            <p class="para-two">Once again, we have a regular combo of a mahogany body and a mahogany set-in neck, as
                well as a rosewood
                fretboard with middle finger inlays. It became his go-to guitar during this period. “EET FUK” ESP
                Explorer also features a pair of EMG humbuckers, 81 and 60 models, which is quite common for James’
                guitars. This instrument is associated with Hetfield’s roaring, the crunch-driven sound of the band’s
                thrash metal peak demonstrated on the “…And Justice for All Tour,” recorded at the iconic 1989 live show
                in Seattle, WA.</p>

        <div class="electra" id="electra">
            <h2>Electra 2236 Flying V</h2>
            <img src="img/Electra-2236-Flying-V.jpg" alt="Electra 2236 Flying V">
            <ul>
                <li>Finish - White</li>
                <li>Years Used - 1980 to 1984/2008 to present</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para-one">For this instrument, we need to go all the way back to 1980, which is even before
                Metallica was formed.
                Back then, James bought a Gibson Flying V copy by Electra, the company’s 2236 model. Reportedly, he paid
                it $200 back then. Although relatively cheaper alternatives back in the day, these instruments are rare
                and they became popular among collectors due to James Hetfield.</p>
            <p class="para-two">Hetfield used it on the “Kill ‘Em All” debut album and it stayed his main workhorse
                until 1984 when he
                managed to snap its neck during a live show. The instrument was restored to a fully functioning state
                back in 2008. The instrument used to have Seymour Duncan Invader pickups, but he swapped them for the
                EMG 81 and 60 set. This guitar is a true deep-cut gem in James’ collection and an item many hardcore
                fans are fascinated with.</p>

                1985</a>
            <p class="para-one">Right after he managed to snap the neck on his precious Electra, James started
                experimenting with
                different guitars. Finally, he settled for a 1984 Gibson Explorer that became popular for its “So What”
                sticker. Back when he got this instrument, it was fitted with Gibson’s 496R and 500T humbuckers.</p>
            <p class="para-two">Later during the 1980s, most likely in 1987, James swapped them for a standard pair of
                EMG 81 and 60
                pickups. The instrument in its original setting saw heavy use on the “Ride the Lightning” record. In
                2008, this instrument was completely restored, just like the Electra Flying V.</p>

        <h2>Wrap up</h2>
        <p class="para-one">Metallica was formed in the early 1980s by young and ambitious Lars Ulrich and James
            Hetfield. Although
            living in the United States, they were mostly inspired by European bands. Giving new life to metal music,
            Metallica combined the music of two different worlds, and along with some other American bands, laid
            foundations for what was labeled as “thrash metal” by the music press and big record labels.</p>
        <p class="para-two">However, what made quite a huge impact on metal music were the band’s heavy, tight, and fast
            riffs played by
            James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett. And it was especially Hetfield’s riffs that changed the game, especially
            with his pretty tight downstroke picking technique and very clever use of palm muting. Even to this day,
            he’s praised for his style of playing and not everyone can copy his exact style. Although some would dismiss
            metal music for just aggressive high-gain electric guitar noise, we can hear a lot of nuances in Hetfield’s
            playing, especially in terms of dynamics and how he’s accentuating some notes, all while sticking to his
            downstroke picking, as well as the alternation between palm muting and open-hand positioning.</p>
        <p class="para-three">But none of Hetfield’s writing and playing practices wouldn’t be what they are without his
            unique tone that
            evolved over the years.</p>
        <p class="para-four">And that’s a wrap! We hope that this article was fun and that you’ve learned something new
            today when it
            comes to the gear and guitars James Hetfield used and is still using, in the almighty Metallica. As you can
            see, the frontman has utilized a variety of gear, including some of his staple marks, as well as some deep
            cuts.</p>
